# VantaHome working context

Last maintained: **2026-10-07**. Read this before rediscovering the project.

## Locations and branch

- Active checkout: `/Users/nick007/Library/Caches/VantaHome/native-device-test`
- Branch: `3d-home-integration`; remote: `NicholasKerr7/vantahome`
- Logs, screenshots, build helpers: `/Users/nick007/Library/Caches/VantaHome/work`
- iOS derived data: `/Users/nick007/Library/Caches/VantaHome/native-derived-data`
- Public staging build configuration (outside Metro/repository):
  `/Users/nick007/Library/Caches/VantaHome/work/staging-client-public.env`
- Scene source: `packages/home-scene/src`; host bridge: `src/features/three-d-home`
- Generated scene bundles are ignored and rebuilt with `npm run build:home-scene`.
  Do not edit generated bundles or rebuild/retest everything without a reason.

## Product decisions to preserve

- 3D-first VantaHome with the original purple palette, modern navigation/cards,
  large furnished mid-poly property, cinematic but subtle motion.
- iPhone/Android phone portrait and tablet portrait/landscape; desktop tablet
  preview. No vertical page scrolling; preserve reduced-motion/touch behavior.
- Three.js is the main scene. Filament is an optional administrator renderer lab,
  disabled in the current authenticated Preview. No product references to Codex.
- Device hotspots: quick controls on mobile, full controls available; tablet
  avoids duplicating the adjacent inspector's quick toggle.
- Simulation first. No hub purchased or connected; NUC 15 is the user's intended
  hub direction. The 20-space/92-device authenticated model is simulation-only.
- Individual accounts and household invitations. Owner/Admin/Member have whole
  home role scope; Guest/Tenant live information and controls follow room grants.
- Property overview is separate from permissions: current invitees see the
  exterior/grounds. Only the Owner can optionally share furnished interiors.
  Shared layout never grants device readings/actions, occupancy, cameras, or
  activity. Unassigned rooms remain layout-only. Do not grant `fullHome` to
  implement this. All source GLBs are still bundled: visual privacy is not
  confidential asset delivery.
- Existing finite Guests use **Extend / Renew access**, not another invitation.
  Owner/authorized Admin can add 1 hour / 24 hours / 7 days or set a custom local deadline within
  365 days. Preserve rooms/actions, reset optional interior consent, and cancel
  superseded pending invitations. The Guest cannot extend their own access.
- Production remains unchanged; iPad physical testing is deferred.

## Environment and confirmed milestones

- Staging Supabase: `dcevusczjtmdpzrxpdou`. Migrations **001–020** applied only here.
  019 adds owner-only interior consent; 020 adds checked Guest deadline changes.
- Use configured CLI/Keychain credentials in memory; never print/store privileged
  keys or put them in `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`. Do not read account credentials into chat.
- Preview bundle: `com.anonymous.vantahome.preview`; scheme `vantahome-preview`.
- Physical iPhone: iPhone 16 Pro Max / UDID `00008140-000171261411801C`.
- Preview 37 user-confirmed: Owner invite/code/password/home/model setup; Guest
  invite and acceptance; Living-room-only access; working Pendant light; blocked
  Front entry door; Guest persistence after reopening; Owner account switch.
- User confirmed Owner password reset from the iPhone, cold email-link return,
  new password, and full Owner home after sign-in. Passwords/codes were not read.
- The original test Guest used 24-hour access ending October 5; do not silently
  extend that grant. Check current server state before further Guest testing.
- Preview 39 Release build **succeeded**; exact bundle/schemes, device coverage and
  strict signature verified. Production metadata restored. Signing profile
  expires **2026-10-11 06:55:16 UTC**. Installed October 7; the physical device's
  app listing confirms 1.0.0 (39), and the developer service launched it.
- The user confirmed the requested Preview 39 iPhone Guest renewal check works:
  renewal, return with the existing account, and retained Living-room/control
  restrictions. Do not repeat that test.
- Preview 39 iPhone offline/reconnect also passed by user report: with Wi-Fi off
  and Airplane Mode on, the supplied screenshot shows **Unable to verify home
  access**, **Retry**, and **Sign out**. Restoring connectivity returned access;
  door control remained blocked. Do not repeat this check or infer whether Retry
  was tapped, how long recovery took, or broader lifecycle behavior from it.

## Current implementation and evidence

Guest Extend/Renew implementation, staging rollout, and Preview 39 installation
are complete. Prior property sharing landed in `9ac2056`. Use
`git log -1` for the latest commit/push state rather than treating an old hash as
current.

- Latest app verification: **176 suites / 2,561 tests**, including 50 service,
  24 deadline-policy and 14 new UI tests. After final tablet/copy tweaks, 47 UI/security
  tests and TypeScript passed again. SQL: all 20 migrations / 482 checks / 10 suites.
- Hosted API passed with exact denial codes. Browser: Owner extend and renew
  succeed; expired Guest **Check access** restores the property with only Living
  room / six devices and door control still blocked. Reviewed 375×667, 768×1024, 1024×768.
- A stale-deadline RPC initially used 40001, exposing PostgREST retry behavior.
  Repaired to 22023; repeated SQL/strict hosted checks pass. No stuck extension RPCs
  remained. Final 020 SHA256: c76ba01f63ffbae32b817cd0578fb26a859db9921dc232ab9caa90dc31524a02.
- Latest logs: `guest-extension-app-tests.log`, `guest-extension-final-ui-tests.log`,
  `guest-extension-final-typecheck.log`, `guest-extension-postgres-test.log`,
  `native-preview-build-39.log` and `native-preview-build-39-summary.log`.
  Receipts: `preview39-install.json`, `preview39-installed-app.json`, `preview39-launch.json`.
  Synthetic QA home/accounts/private file removed; browser sessions and task's 5184
  Expo server closed. No real Guest renewed automatically; production unchanged.

Previous property-sharing evidence (no scene source changed for Preview 39):

- Full `npm run verify`: **2,464 app tests / 173 suites**, **738 scene tests /
  62 files**, **127 bridge tests**, **45 script tests**, app/edge TypeScript,
  dependency and release checks passed.
- Fresh isolated PostgreSQL 17: all 19 migrations and **414 checks / nine suites**
  passed. Database stopped/removed by its runner.
- Hosted staging with disposable accounts: Owner share/revoke works; Guest RPC
  self-grant and direct-column mutation rejected; six visible devices unchanged.
- Authenticated browser: Owner switch saves; Guest opens full shared upper floor
  without private hotspots; revocation returns the open tour to exterior at the
  next membership refresh; assigned Pendant light still toggles; door stays
  disabled. No browser errors. Reviewed 375×667, 430×932, 768×1024 and 1024×768.
- Remote membership edits refresh normally within 60 seconds plus network time or
  on foreground return. Store-to-renderer scope changes are immediate.
- Logs: `property-overview-verify.log`, `interior-layout-postgres-test.log`,
  `property-overview-scene-build.log`, `native-preview-build-38-summary.log`,
  `native-preview-build-38.log`, all in the work directory above.
- External QA helper: `property-overview-qa.cjs`. Its synthetic `@example.invalid`
  accounts/home and temporary private credential record were removed October 7.
  No active task-owned browser sessions or port 5177 server remained at cleanup.
- Install/launch receipts: `preview38-install.json`, `preview38-installed-app.json`,
  `preview38-launch.json`, in the work directory. These establish installation
  and launch, not a physical UI review.

## Resume next

1. Next physical check: Owner shared-interior consent and Guest layout/revocation.
   Guest renewal and offline/reconnect with retained door restrictions already
   passed by the user's report; do not repeat them.
2. Other physical checks: online background/resume, warm recovery,
   explicit invitation-link routing, and observed Guest deadline expiry.
   Do not represent automated/browser results as physical-device results.
3. Continue work from relevant source/tests and cached evidence; do not rerun all
   checks or rediscover the repository merely to resume. Recheck volatile state.
